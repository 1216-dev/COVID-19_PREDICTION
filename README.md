Project Overview
This project leverages a deep learning-based classifier to automate the analysis of chest X-ray images, categorizing them into COVID-positive, lung opacity, normal, and viral pneumonia classes. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, the model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify visual patterns in X-rays, potentially aiding radiologists in diagnostic decision-making.

Dataset
The dataset is sourced from COVID-19 Radiography Database on Kaggle, consisting of X-ray images classified into COVID, Normal, Lung Opacity, and Viral Pneumonia categories.
